## Getting Started

Please download the software specified on the [Overview](Overview.qmd) page as soon as possible. If you plan to use the Apporto Virtual Desktop, please set up your account before the Day One practicum. Please reach out if you need any help. Additionally, please download the *QuantDiffForecast* toolbox from GitHub prior to the lab and view the associated tutorial.

The *QuantDiffForecast* toolbox has both video and written tutorials available, and we highly recommend that both be viewed. We will also cover the toolbox during the lab on Day One of the module.

Prior to the second half of the course, please make sure to download the most recent version of R and RStudio. Multiple R-packages are also needed prior to completing the second practicum. These include

-   learnr
-   tidyverse
-   tinytex
-   rstan
-   bayesplot
-   rstantools
-   desolve.

The [Additional Resources](additionaDetails.qmd) page contains tutorials on how to access Apporto, prepare MATLAB, download both R and Rstudio, and on downloading packages in R. It also contains the links to the *QuantDiffForecast* toolbox and the associated tutorial.

## Readings and Additional Slides 

While the readings for this module are optional. We highly recommend that you take a look at the following papers as they will help facilitate use of the *QuantDiffForecast Toolbox*, and will provide additional insight into the materials we will cover over the next few days.
