    "text": "Module Summary\nMathematical models based on systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are frequently applied in various scientific fields to assess hypotheses, estimate key model parameters, and generate predictions about the system’s state. To support their application, this module introduces frequentist and Bayesian methods for estimating parameters and generating short-term forecasts with quantified uncertainty from dynamical models. Motivating practical examples will be based on epidemic models with varying levels of complexity. The course includes a general introduction to Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo, and MCMC.\nThe course includes a general introduction to Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo, and MCMC. Some relevant facts from the Markov chain theory are reviewed. Algorithms include Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings. A practical introduction to convergence diagnostics is included. The module will alternate between lectures and computer labs."
