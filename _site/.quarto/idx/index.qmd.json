To support their application, this module introduces frequentist and Bayesian methods for estimating parameters and generating short-term forecasts with quantified uncertainty from dynamical models. Motivating practical examples will be based on epidemic models with varying levels of complexity. The course includes a general introduction to Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo, and MCMC.\n\nThe course includes a general introduction to Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo, and MCMC. Some relevant facts from the Markov chain theory are reviewed. Algorithms include Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings. A practical introduction to convergence diagnostics is included. The module will alternate between lectures and computer labs.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis module assumes knowledge of probability and inference covered in an introductory statistical course. Students will learn to use R and MATLAB toolboxes designed for parameter estimation and forecasting using dynamic models. Students are expected to have basic knowledge of the R computing environment. Students new to R should complete a tutorial before the module.\n\n## Required Software\n\n**Software:** R, R-Studio, MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.)\n\n**R Packages:** Stan\n\n**MATLAB Packages:** Curve Fitting Toolbox, Global Optimization Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Simulink, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\n\nEmory has also provided us with access to the Apporto Virtual Desktop.
