Additionally, please download the QuantDiffForecast toolbox from GitHub prior to the lab and view the associated tutorial.\nThe QuantDiffForecast toolbox has both video and written tutorials available, and we highly recommend that both be viewed. We will also cover the toolbox during the lab on Day One of the module.\nPrior to the second half of the course, please make sure to download the most recent version of R and RStudio. Multiple R-packages are also needed prior to completing the second practicum. These include\n\nlearnr\ntidyverse\ntinytex\nrstan\nbayesplot\nrstantools\ndesolve.\n\nThe Additional Resources page contains tutorials on how to access Apporto, prepare MATLAB, download both R and Rstudio, and on downloading packages in R.
